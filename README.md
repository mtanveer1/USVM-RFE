# Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease using universum support vectormachine based recursive feature elimination (USVM-RFE)

This is implementation of the paper: B. Richhariya, M. Tanveer, A.H. Rashid and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2020. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using universum support vector machine based recursive feature elimination (USVM-RFE). Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 59, p.101903, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.101903.

Description of files:

USVM_RFE.m: Selects the features using USVM-RFE algorithm.

For running the USVM-RFE algorithm, we have included the wpbc dataset. One can simply run the USVM_RFE.m file to check the obtained results on this sample dataset. To run experiments on more datasets, simply add datasets in the folder and run USVM_RFE.m file. For selecting the optimal parameters, one can do the standard training of USVM first using USVM.m file.
